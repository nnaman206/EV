<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

About The Project
With the rise of electric vehicles, the demand for efficient charging infrastructure has never been higher. The EV Charger Allocator aims to solve the problem of long waiting lines and inefficient charger utilization at charging stations.

This project provides a smart allocation system that connects EV drivers with available chargers in real-time. It uses an intelligent algorithm to manage demand and supply, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free charging experience for everyone.
